# Curriculum

The intent of this curriculum is to create a more "top-down" approach in teaching people how to code. The impetus for this decision is recognizing that initial rewards are extremely slow and painful (and BORING). By creating a curriculum that allows the user to start completing their own projects quickly, a positive reward system is more easily implemented.
